===== Firmware =====

  *combination of all code running on the device
  *consists of bootloader, kernel, file system and other resources

===Usage for pentesters===
  *finding hidden secrets - backdoor,passwords,API keys,private certificates
  *vulnerabilites in individual binaries
  *emulate firmware binaries or firmware itself
  *understand and prepare a similar device  
  *creation of malicious firmware image

===first look===
  *using hexdump and strings
  *<code>hexdump -C <binary></code>

====typical filesystems====
  *squashFS
    *one of the most common file types in embedded devices
    *could use unsquashfs and modified version ( with lzma decompression )
  *cramFS
  *JFFS2
  *YAFFS2
  *ext2

===finding file system offset===
  *we can identify the file sytem offset
  *for example squashFS has the string "shsq" at the beginning of the filesystem
  *<code>hexdump -C <binary> | less | grep -i shsq</code>
  *the hexdump match gives the entry address for the file system
  *another option is to use binwalk to get several different memory areas

===dumping data from specific offset===
  *using dd we can dump from a binary using a specific offset
  *<code>dd if=<binary> skip=<offset> bs=1 of=<of_name>
  *now we have to prepare the file system dump for using it
  *<code>unsquashfs_all.sh <filesystem binary></code>

  *otherwise you could use binwalk to automate these steps
===interesting files===

==DLink==
  */etc/config/image_sign contains hardcoded telnet credentials


====Emulating Firmware====

  *change into squash-fs root directory
  *<code>chroot . ./<qemu-binary> ./<binary_to_emulate></code>
